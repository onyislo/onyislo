👋 Hi, I’m @onyislo  
👀 I’m interested in software development, web development, embedded systems, and cybersecurity — especially pentesting, ethical hacking, and bug bounty hunting.  
🌱 Always exploring better ways to create clean, efficient, and scalable code.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, side hustles, or anything tech that’s exciting and impactful.  
📫 Reach me on Discord: onyisoo  
😄 Pronouns: he/him  
⚡ Fun fact: Coding never gets old — it’s like solving a new puzzle every day.
